- `jsonwebtoken`: JSON Web Token implementation for user authentication.
- `multer`: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.
- `nodemailer`: Module for sending emails, utilized for notifications and alerts.
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express applications.
- `dotenv`: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

## Getting Started

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding necessary configurations (e.g., MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, email service configurations).
